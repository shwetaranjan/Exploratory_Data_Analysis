# Exploratory Data Analysis on US Accidents (2016 - 2021)
This is Python based Exploratory Data Analysis on "US Accidents" dataset to find out and visualize different trends including traffic behavior and accidents, environmental stimuli on accident occurrence and accident hotspot locations in order to get control over the same.

## About Dataset
**US-Accidents: A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset**
### Description
This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers **49 states of the USA**. The accident data are collected from **February 2016 to Dec 2021**, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about **2.8 million** accident records in this dataset.
### Content
This dataset has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains accident data that are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2021 for the Contiguous United States. Check here to learn more about this dataset.
### Applications of Dataset
US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications such as real-time accident prediction, studying accident hotspot locations, casualty analysis and extracting cause and effect rules to predict accidents, or studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence.

### Some Interesting Insights :
1. A high percentage of accidents occur between 3pm to 5pm. (probably because people drive their vehicles carelessly and recklessly due to thin vehicular traffic during these hours).<br>
2. Next highest percentage of accidents is from 6am to 9am(probably because people are in a hurry to reach for work).<br>
3. On Sundays, the peak of accidentsoccurs between 2pm to 5pm unlike which is similar to monday where peek occurs between 3pm to 5pm.<br>
4. The trend of accidents is lower during the summers (from jan to july) whereas the maximum trend of accidents is increasing from (September to December).<br>
5. The maximum number of accidents tend to occur during peak winter season (December).<br>
6. Less than 5% of cities have more than 1000 yearly accidents.<br>
